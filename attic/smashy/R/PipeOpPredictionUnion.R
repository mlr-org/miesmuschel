#'
#' @description
#' Combine [`Prediction`][mlr3::Prediction]` made for different subsets of a [`Task`][mlr3::Task] into a combined [`Prediction`][mlr3::Prediction].
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpPredictionUnion$new(id = "predictionunion", param_vals = list())
#' ```
#'
#' * `innum` :: `numeric(1)` | `character`\cr
#'   Determines the number of input channels.
#'   If `innum` is 0 (default), a vararg input channel is created that can take an arbitrary number
#'   of inputs. If `innum` is a `character` vector, the number of input channels is the length of
#'   `innum`, and the columns of the result are prefixed with the values.
#' * `collect_multiplicity` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   If `TRUE`, the input is a [`Multiplicity`] collecting channel. This means, a
#'   [`Multiplicity`] input, instead of multiple normal inputs, is accepted and the members are aggregated. This requires `innum` to be 0.
#'   Default is `FALSE`.
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`
#'   Identifier of the resulting object, default `"predictionunion"`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise
#'   be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' [`PipeOpPredictionUnion`] has multiple input channels depending on the `innum` construction
#' argument, named `"input1"`, `"input2"`, ... if `innum` is nonzero; if `innum` is 0, there is
#' only one *vararg* input channel named `"..."`. All input channels take `NULL` during training and a [`Prediction`][mlr3::Prediction]
#' object during prediction.
#'
#' [`PipeOpPredictionUnion`] has one output channel named `"output"`, producing `NULL` during training and a [`Prediction`][mlr3::Prediction]
#' object during prediction.
#'
#' The output is a [`Prediction`][mlr3::Prediction] constructed by `c()`ing (effectively `rbind`-ing) all [`Prediction`][mlr3::Prediction]s during prediction.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is left empty (`list()`).
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' [`PipeOpPredictionUnion`] has no parameters.
#'
#' @section Internals:
#' [`PipeOpPredictionUnion`] uses the [`Prediction`][mlr3::Prediction] S3 `c()` method provided by `mlr3`.
